    <h2>Introduction to VWAP</h2>
    <p>The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical analysis indicator used on intraday charts that resets at
        the start of every new trading session.

        It's a trading benchmark that represents the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on
        both volume and price.

        VWAP is important because it provides traders with pricing insight into both the trend and value of a security.
